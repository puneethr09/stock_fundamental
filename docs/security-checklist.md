- [ ] Certificate chain is complete
- [ ] Private key permissions are 600
- [ ] Certificate expiration is monitored
- [ ] HSTS header is enabled
- [ ] SSL protocols are TLS 1.2/1.3 only

### 2. Container Security
- [ ] Non-root user is used in containers
- [ ] Minimal base images are used
- [ ] Security updates are applied
- [ ] Unnecessary packages are removed
- [ ] Container capabilities are dropped
- [ ] Read-only root filesystem where possible

### 3. Network Security
- [ ] Nginx is configured as reverse proxy
- [ ] Security headers are enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF) is considered
- [ ] Internal services are not exposed externally

### 4. Application Security
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] SQL injection prevention is in place
- [ ] XSS protection is enabled
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented
- [ ] Secure session management is used

### 5. Data Protection
- [ ] Database backups are encrypted
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Backup files have restricted permissions
- [ ] Database credentials are secured
- [ ] API keys are properly managed

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Log files are monitored
- [ ] Alert system is configured
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled

## Production Deployment Commands

```bash
# Run security hardening
./scripts/security-harden.sh

# Create non-root user
./scripts/create-user.sh

# Apply Docker security
./scripts/docker-security.sh

# Generate SSL certificates
./scripts/generate-ssl.sh

# Run backup
./scripts/backup.sh
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run services with minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Deny by default, allow explicitly
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and alerting
6. **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure backups
