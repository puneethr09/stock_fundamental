# Risk Mitigation Strategies

## Technical Risk Management

**Data Source Reliability:**

- Implement multiple fallback data sources
- Create data quality validation pipelines
- Add manual data override capabilities
- Monitor API changes with automated alerts

**Performance Optimization:**

- Implement progressive loading for mobile devices
- Use database indexing and query optimization
- Add connection pooling and request batching
- Monitor resource usage with automated scaling

**Cross-Device Compatibility:**

- Establish comprehensive device testing matrix
- Implement feature detection and graceful degradation
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout consistency
- Test touch interactions across different screen sizes

## Integration Risk Management

**Backward Compatibility:**

- Maintain API versioning strategy
- Create migration scripts for data compatibility
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Provide rollback procedures for each deployment

**System Reliability:**

- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create health check endpoints for monitoring
- Establish incident response procedures
