# Stock Fundamental Analysis Platform - Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of the stock_fundamental repository

**Current Project State**:
The project is a Flask-based web application for stock market fundamental analysis that currently provides:

- Stock financial ratio analysis using yfinance data
- Market news aggregation from multiple RSS sources
- Interactive Plotly visualizations of financial metrics
- Docker-based deployment architecture
- Auto-complete functionality for stock ticker search

The application follows a basic MVC pattern with Flask routes handling web requests, business logic in `src/` modules, and HTML templates for the UI. The current codebase shows signs of technical debt with mixed concerns, lengthy functions, and limited separation of data access from business logic.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:

- ☐ Tech Stack Documentation
- ☐ Source Tree/Architecture
- ☐ Coding Standards
- ☐ API Documentation
- ☐ External API Documentation
- ☐ UX/UI Guidelines
- ☐ Technical Debt Documentation

**Assessment**: Critical documentation is missing. The codebase lacks architectural documentation, coding standards, and technical debt analysis.

**Impact Assessment**:

- ✓ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:

- Refactor codebase into a clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Implement comprehensive fundamental analysis based on "The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing"
- Add market and individual stock sentiment analysis capabilities
- Create a modern, intuitive web interface for enhanced user experience
- Establish comprehensive testing framework ensuring reliability at each development phase
- Optimize performance and explore deployment alternatives to Docker for Raspberry Pi hosting
- Maintain and enhance existing working features (auto-completion, current analysis features)
- Enable local network access for family/team usage

**Background Context**:
The current application provides basic fundamental analysis but lacks the depth and sophistication needed for serious investment analysis. The "Five Rules" methodology offers a proven framework for stock evaluation that could significantly enhance the application's value. Additionally, incorporating sentiment analysis will provide crucial market psychology insights that complement fundamental data. The refactoring addresses technical debt while positioning the application for future enhancements and better maintainability.

**Infrastructure**: Docker containerization (current), exploring alternatives for Raspberry Pi deployment
**External Dependencies**: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, pytz for RSS feeds

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Implement SQLite for development/local deployment and PostgreSQL option for production. Add data models for caching analysis results, user preferences, and historical sentiment data.

**API Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing Flask routes while adding new RESTful endpoints for sentiment analysis and Five Rules methodology. Implement API versioning to support future enhancements.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Jinja2 templates with modern CSS framework. Add JavaScript modules for interactive features while maintaining server-side rendering approach.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement pytest framework with fixtures for database testing, mock external API calls, and automated browser testing using Selenium.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Implement clean architecture with separate layers for data access, business logic, and presentation. Organize modules by feature rather than by technical layer.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow PEP 8 conventions with descriptive naming. Use domain-specific terminology for financial concepts and consistent patterns across modules.

**Coding Standards**: Implement type hints, docstrings, and comprehensive error handling. Use dependency injection for testability and configuration management.

**Documentation Standards**: Maintain comprehensive README, API documentation with examples, and architectural decision records (ADRs) for major design choices.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Maintain Docker compatibility while adding support for direct Python deployment on Raspberry Pi. Implement automated dependency management and configuration validation.

**Deployment Strategy**: Support both containerized and native deployment options. Include database migration scripts and configuration templates for different environments.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Implement structured logging with configurable levels, performance monitoring, and health check endpoints for system monitoring.

**Configuration Management**: Use environment-based configuration with secure handling of API keys and sensitive data.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Data source reliability (yfinance API changes), performance impact of sentiment analysis processing, memory constraints on Raspberry Pi deployment.

**Integration Risks**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring, compatibility issues with current data processing, potential downtime during migration.

**Deployment Risks**: Raspberry Pi resource limitations, network connectivity requirements for data sources, backup and recovery procedures.

**Mitigation Strategies**: Implement comprehensive testing at each phase, gradual migration approach with rollback capabilities, performance benchmarking throughout development, and clear deployment documentation.
