# Stock Fundamental Analysis Platform - Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of the stock_fundamental repository

**Current Project State**:
The project is a Flask-based web application for Indian stock market fundamental analysis that currently provides:

- Indian stock financial ratio analysis using yfinance data (NSE/BSE listings)
- Indian market news aggregation from multiple RSS sources (Economic Times, Business Standard, LiveMint, Hindu BusinessLine)
- Interactive Plotly visualizations of financial metrics
- Docker-based deployment architecture
- Auto-complete functionality for Indian stock ticker search

The application follows a basic MVC pattern with Flask routes handling web requests, business logic in `src/` modules, and HTML templates for the UI. The current codebase shows signs of technical debt with mixed concerns, lengthy functions, and limited separation of data access from business logic.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:

- ☐ Tech Stack Documentation
- ☐ Source Tree/Architecture
- ☐ Coding Standards
- ☐ API Documentation
- ☐ External API Documentation
- ☐ UX/UI Guidelines
- ☐ Technical Debt Documentation

**Assessment**: Critical documentation is missing. The codebase lacks architectural documentation, coding standards, and technical debt analysis.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**:

- ✓ New Feature Addition
- ✓ Major Feature Modification
- ✓ Performance/Scalability Improvements
- ✓ UI/UX Overhaul
- ✓ Technology Stack Upgrade
- ✓ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements

**Enhancement Description**:
This is a comprehensive system refactoring and enhancement that will modernize the architecture, add sophisticated fundamental analysis features based on "The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing", implement sentiment analysis capabilities, improve the web interface, and establish a robust testing framework while maintaining existing functionality.

**Impact Assessment**:

- ✓ Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:

- Refactor codebase into a clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Implement comprehensive fundamental analysis based on "The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing"
- Add market and individual stock sentiment analysis capabilities
- Create a modern, intuitive web interface for enhanced user experience
- Establish comprehensive testing framework ensuring reliability at each development phase
- Optimize performance and explore deployment alternatives to Docker for Raspberry Pi hosting
- Maintain and enhance existing working features (auto-completion, current analysis features)
- Enable local network access for family/team usage

**Background Context**:
The current application provides basic fundamental analysis but lacks the depth and sophistication needed for serious investment analysis. The "Five Rules" methodology offers a proven framework for stock evaluation that could significantly enhance the application's value. Additionally, incorporating sentiment analysis will provide crucial market psychology insights that complement fundamental data. The refactoring addresses technical debt while positioning the application for future enhancements and better maintainability.

The interface must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, mobile, and iPad devices while maintaining the professional appearance expected in financial applications. Touch-optimized interactions and adaptive layouts must ensure optimal user experience on all device types.

## 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.10+, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
**Frameworks**: Flask 2.x, Plotly for visualizations, yfinance for Indian market data (NSE/BSE)
**Database**: Current implementation uses in-memory processing; enhancement will add SQLite/PostgreSQL for data persistence
**Infrastructure**: Docker containerization (current), exploring alternatives for Raspberry Pi deployment
**External Dependencies**: yfinance (Indian stocks), pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, pytz for Indian RSS feeds

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Implement SQLite for development/local deployment and PostgreSQL option for production. Add data models for caching analysis results, user preferences, and historical sentiment data.

**API Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing Flask routes for backward compatibility OR completely redesign for improved RESTful architecture, adding new endpoints for sentiment analysis and Five Rules methodology. Implement API versioning to support future enhancements.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Jinja2 templates with modern CSS framework ensuring full cross-device compatibility (PC, mobile, tablet, iPad). Add JavaScript modules for interactive features while maintaining server-side rendering approach.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement pytest framework with fixtures for database testing, mock external API calls, and automated browser testing using Selenium.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Implement clean architecture with separate layers for data access, business logic, and presentation. Organize modules by feature rather than by technical layer.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow PEP 8 conventions with descriptive naming. Use domain-specific terminology for financial concepts and consistent patterns across modules.

**Coding Standards**: Implement type hints, comprehensive docstrings, and proper error handling. Use dependency injection for testability and configuration management. Follow clean coding principles with meaningful variable names, single responsibility functions, and proper code organization.

**Documentation Standards**: Maintain comprehensive README, API documentation with examples, architectural decision records (ADRs) for major design choices, and educational explanations for financial concepts within the application.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Maintain Docker compatibility while adding support for direct Python deployment on Raspberry Pi. Implement automated dependency management and configuration validation.

**Deployment Strategy**: Support both containerized and native deployment options. Include database migration scripts and configuration templates for different environments.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Implement structured logging with configurable levels, performance monitoring, and health check endpoints for system monitoring.

**Configuration Management**: Use environment-based configuration with secure handling of API keys and sensitive data.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Data source reliability (yfinance API changes for Indian stocks), performance impact of sentiment analysis processing, memory constraints on Raspberry Pi deployment, cross-device compatibility challenges.

**Integration Risks**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring, compatibility issues with current Indian stock data processing, potential downtime during migration.

**Deployment Risks**: Raspberry Pi resource limitations, network connectivity requirements for Indian market data sources, backup and recovery procedures.

**Mitigation Strategies**: Implement comprehensive testing at each phase, gradual migration approach with rollback capabilities, performance benchmarking throughout development, cross-device testing strategy, and clear deployment documentation.

## 5. Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic is optimal for brownfield enhancement with rationale: This enhancement involves tightly interconnected components (architecture, Five Rules analysis, sentiment analysis, UI, educational features) that share common infrastructure changes and benefit from coordinated development to avoid integration conflicts. A single epic ensures consistent cross-device compatibility, educational integration, and clean coding standards throughout all components.

**Alternative Considered**: Multiple smaller epics could be used if the scope becomes unmanageable, but the interconnected nature of improvements (UI changes affecting all features, educational explanations touching all analysis components) makes a single epic more efficient.
