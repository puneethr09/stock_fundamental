## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundation for the Financial Education Mastery Framework from the brownfield architecture. The system establishes a 4-stage learning progression that adapts content and interface based on user behavioral analytics.

**Learning Stage Definitions:**

**Stage 1 - Guided Discovery** (2-4 weeks):

- Heavy tooltip usage, needs explanations for basic ratios
- High warning attention, clicks on info buttons frequently
- Completes basic analysis but doesn't explore research guides
- **UI Adaptations**: More tooltips, simplified language, basic educational content

**Stage 2 - Assisted Analysis** (4-8 weeks):

- Moderate tooltip usage, starts recognizing patterns
- Engages with research guides from gap-filling system
- Begins making connections between different ratios
- **UI Adaptations**: Intermediate explanations, pattern highlighting, guided research

**Stage 3 - Independent Thinking** (8-16 weeks):

- Low tooltip usage, confident with basic ratios
- Actively uses research guides and community insights
- Makes analysis predictions and comparisons across stocks
- **UI Adaptations**: Advanced content, confidence building exercises, peer insights

**Stage 4 - Analytical Mastery** (Ongoing):

- Minimal tooltip usage, teaches others via community contributions
- Creates high-quality community insights and research findings
- Handles complex analysis scenarios independently
- **UI Adaptations**: Expert mode, teaching tools, advanced pattern recognition

**Behavioral Analytics Tracking:**

- Tooltip interaction frequency and duration
- Warning section engagement (info button clicks)
- Research guide completion rates
- Community insight contribution quality
- Analysis session duration and depth
- Cross-stock comparison behavior

### Existing System Integration

**Integration Points:**

- **Flask Session**: Extend existing session management in `app.py` routes
- **Analysis Results**: Hook into `analyze_ratios()` output processing in `src/basic_analysis.py`
- **UI Templates**: Enhance `templates/results.html` with stage-appropriate content
- **Gap-Filling System**: Connect with existing educational gap detection
- **Community System**: Integrate with existing community insight quality tracking

**Data Flow Integration:**

```
User Analysis → Behavioral Tracking → Stage Assessment → Adaptive Content → Learning Progress
```

**Storage Architecture:**

- **Browser localStorage**: Persistent behavioral data (7-day rolling window)
- **Flask Session**: Current session behavioral tracking
- **No Database**: Maintains existing architecture, no user accounts required

### Technical Implementation Details

**Core Implementation:**

- **File**: `src/educational_framework.py`
- **Class**: `EducationalMasteryFramework`
- **Integration**: Called from Flask routes and analysis processing

**Key Methods:**

```python
def track_user_behavior(session_data, interaction_type, interaction_data)
def assess_learning_stage(behavioral_history)
def get_stage_appropriate_content(current_stage, analysis_context)
def update_stage_progress(user_actions, current_stage)
```

**Behavioral Scoring Algorithm:**

- **Tooltip Dependency Score**: Frequency and duration of tooltip usage
- **Analysis Depth Score**: Engagement with warnings, research guides, community insights
- **Pattern Recognition Score**: Cross-stock analysis patterns, prediction accuracy
- **Teaching Contribution Score**: Community insight quality and helpfulness

**Stage-Adaptive Content System:**

- **Tooltip Complexity**: Adjusts explanation depth based on stage
- **Educational Content**: Filters gap-filling research guides by difficulty
- **UI Elements**: Shows/hides advanced features based on readiness
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback on learning progression

### Key Constraints

**Privacy-First Design:**

- No personal identifiers stored (anonymous behavioral tracking only)
- All data stored in browser localStorage + Flask session (no server-side user data)
- 7-day rolling window data retention policy
- GDPR-compliant anonymous analytics

**Performance Requirements:**

- Stage assessment processing < 50ms per analysis request
- Behavioral tracking adds < 25ms to existing analysis workflow
- localStorage operations must be non-blocking
- Adaptive content delivery < 20ms additional template rendering

**Integration Constraints:**

- Must work seamlessly with existing Community Knowledge Base system
- Must enhance (not replace) existing Educational Gap-Filling research guides
- Stage progression must feel natural and non-intrusive
- All existing tooltip and warning functionality preserved

**Technical Constraints:**

- Works offline with cached behavioral data
- Cross-browser localStorage compatibility required
- Mobile-responsive stage indicators and adaptive content
- Graceful degradation when localStorage unavailable
