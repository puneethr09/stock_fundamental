## Dev Agent Record

Agent: GitHub Copilot

Implementation Date: 2025-08-30

Summary of work performed by the development agent:

- Implemented Research Guidance System core class and APIs (`src/research_guidance_system.py`) with deterministic assignment generation and evaluation logic.
- Added a lightweight SQLite persistence layer and helpers (`src/persistence.py`) for assignments, completions, badges, progress metrics, and notifications.
- Wired gamification to persist and load progress and badges (`src/gamified_progress_tracker.py`) and added award/notification persistence.
- Integrated behavioral analytics to persist achievement notifications (`src/behavioral_analytics.py`).
- Exposed Flask endpoints and routes to create assignments, submit completions (evaluation → gamification), and fetch user badges/progress/notifications (updates to `app.py`).
- Added minimal UI templates for assignment display and achievements (`templates/research_assignment.html`, `templates/achievements.html`).
- Added End-to-End test covering assignment creation → completion → badge/notification awarding (`tests/test_e2e_research_flow.py`) and updated/ran existing gamification tests.

Files changed/added (file list):

- `src/research_guidance_system.py` — Research assignment generation and evaluation logic
- `src/persistence.py` — SQLite persistence helpers and schema
- `src/gamified_progress_tracker.py` — Gamification logic updated to use persistence
- `src/behavioral_analytics.py` — Persist achievement notifications and integration hooks
- `app.py` — Flask routes for research assignments, completions, and user badge/progress endpoints
- `templates/research_assignment.html` — Assignment UI (minimal)
- `templates/achievements.html` — Achievements/notifications UI (minimal)
- `tests/test_e2e_research_flow.py` — End-to-end test for research flow and gamification

Automated validation and QA summary:

- Unit & integration tests executed: `tests/test_gamified_progress_tracker.py`, `tests/test_e2e_research_flow.py` (targeted suite)
- Test results: All targeted tests passed locally during implementation. Full pytest run completed with no failing tests reported at time of update.

Notes & next steps:

- UI polish: improve rendering of badges and notifications (currently minimal JSON-based UI).
- DB migration/versioning: consider adding a migration script for the `data/research.db` schema for production rollouts.
- Additional E2E tests: add scenarios that exercise badge thresholds and long-running progress flows.

Debug log references:

- Local test run outputs and brief test logs were recorded during implementation; see `Completion Notes` below for a short summary.
