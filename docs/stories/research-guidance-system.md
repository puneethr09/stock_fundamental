# Story: Research Guidance System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** platform user needing to research information not available in free data sources,
**I want** personalized research assignments and homework that guide me through manual stock research,
**so that** I can learn professional research techniques and complete comprehensive analysis independently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System generates personalized research homework based on identified analysis gaps
2. Research assignments include step-by-step instructions, success criteria, and time estimates
3. System provides evaluation frameworks for qualitative research (moats, management, competition)
4. Research completion tracking integrates with learning progress and gamification
5. Existing gap identification and analysis functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New research assignments follow existing educational content delivery patterns
7. Integration with learning progress maintains current tracking behavior
8. Research assignment generation is covered by unit and integration tests
9. Assignment instructions are actionable and include Indian market context
10. No regression in existing educational and analysis functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement ResearchGuidanceSystem class with assignment generation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create personalized homework generation based on analysis gaps
  - [ ] Add step-by-step research instructions with success criteria
  - [ ] Implement evaluation frameworks for qualitative research areas
- [ ] Integrate with existing educational systems (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Connect research assignments with gap identification system
  - [ ] Integrate completion tracking with learning progress
  - [ ] Follow existing educational content delivery patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing and Indian market context (AC: 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Unit tests for ResearchGuidanceSystem
  - [ ] Indian market specific examples and sources
  - [ ] Regression testing for existing functionality

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the Research Guidance System from the Financial Education Mastery Framework:

**Focus Areas:**

- Moat Detective Challenges
- Management Assessment
- Competitive Analysis
- Industry Research

The system teaches users professional research techniques that complement quantitative analysis.

### Key Constraints

- Research assignments must be actionable using only free/public sources
- Instructions must be specific to Indian stock market context
- Assignments must build research skills progressively

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_research_guidance.py`
- **Framework**: pytest (following existing test patterns)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for research guidance functionality

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Educational gap-filling service, analysis results system, learning progress tracking
- Technology: Python/Flask backend, existing educational content system, progress tracking
- Follows pattern: Existing educational content delivery and assignment tracking patterns
- Touch points: Gap identification system, analysis results, learning progress system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. System generates personalized research homework based on identified analysis gaps
2. Research assignments include step-by-step instructions, success criteria, and time estimates
3. System provides evaluation frameworks for qualitative research (moats, management, competition)
4. Research completion tracking integrates with learning progress and gamification

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing gap identification and analysis functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New research assignments follow existing educational content delivery patterns
7. Integration with learning progress maintains current tracking behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Research assignment generation is covered by unit and integration tests
9. Assignment instructions are actionable and include Indian market context
10. No regression in existing educational and analysis functionality verified

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**

- Add ResearchGuidanceSystem class for generating personalized research assignments
- Extend educational gap-filling service to trigger research homework creation
- Integrate research completion tracking with existing learning progress system

**Existing Pattern Reference:**

- Follow current educational content generation patterns from gap-filling service
- Use existing learning progress tracking for research completion
- Maintain current assignment delivery and tracking approaches

**Key Constraints:**

- Research assignments must be actionable using only free/public sources
- Instructions must be specific to Indian stock market context
- Assignments must build research skills progressively

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ResearchGuidanceSystem class implemented with assignment generation logic
- [ ] Personalized homework generation based on analysis gaps and user learning stage
- [ ] Evaluation frameworks for qualitative research areas (moats, management, industry)
- [ ] Research completion tracking integrated with learning progress system
- [ ] Existing educational functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing Flask/Python patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Research assignment quality verified with Indian stock examples

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Research assignments could be too complex or time-consuming for users
- **Mitigation:** Progressive difficulty, clear time estimates, optional assignment completion
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable research assignments, fallback to existing gap identification

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing educational or analysis APIs
- [ ] Research tracking is additive to current learning progress system
- [ ] UI integration enhances learning without disrupting existing workflows
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 50ms additional processing time)
