- Badge logic must be privacy-focused and stored locally
- Achievement system must motivate without creating pressure

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MasteryProgression class implemented with badge and milestone logic
- [ ] Learning streak tracking integrated with existing session management
- [ ] Achievement display integrated with current UI without breaking layout
- [ ] Four mastery levels (Seedling, Detective, Eagle, Mentor) working correctly
- [ ] Existing learning functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing Flask/Python and JavaScript patterns
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Gamification motivation verified without creating pressure

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Gamification could create pressure or distract from learning goals
- **Mitigation:** Focus on progress celebration rather than competition, optional display
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable gamification, fallback to existing progress tracking

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing learning assessment APIs
- [ ] Local storage changes are additive to existing session data
- [ ] UI changes enhance learning experience without cluttering interface
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (< 25ms additional processing)
