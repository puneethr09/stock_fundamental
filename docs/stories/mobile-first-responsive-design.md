- Use existing template inheritance and CSS organization
- Maintain current Flask template rendering approach

**Key Constraints:**

- Must work with existing Bootstrap 4.5.2 dependency
- No breaking changes to current styling patterns
- Maintain current performance characteristics

## Definition of Done

- [x] Mobile-first CSS implemented with responsive breakpoints
- [x] All existing templates updated with responsive Bootstrap classes
- [x] Charts and visualizations adapted for mobile display
- [x] Touch-friendly navigation and form interactions implemented
- [x] Existing desktop functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing CSS/template organization patterns
- [x] Cross-device testing completed (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [x] Performance impact verified (no significant increase in load times)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Mitigation:** Progressive enhancement approach, desktop-first fallbacks
- **Rollback:** CSS class toggles to revert to desktop-only layout

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing template structure or styling
- [x] Mobile enhancements are additive to current Bootstrap implementation
- [x] Responsive design enhances accessibility without disrupting workflows
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (< 10% increase in CSS size)
