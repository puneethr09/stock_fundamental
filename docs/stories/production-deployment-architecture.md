# Story: Production Deployment Architecture

## Status

Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** platform operator running an educational stock analysis platform,
**I want** robust production deployment architecture with monitoring, scaling, and reliability features,
**so that** I can serve users reliably with high availability and performance at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for application health and performance
3. Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures for user data and progress
4. Security hardening including HTTPS, authentication, and data protection
5. Existing Docker development setup continues to work unchanged
6. Production deployment follows established containerization patterns
7. Integration maintains current application architecture and data flow
8. Deployment configuration is covered by infrastructure tests and validation
9. Monitoring provides actionable alerts for all critical system components
10. No regression in existing Docker development workflow verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Next steps

- Create production `docker-compose.prod.yml` with nginx reverse proxy and environment variables.
- Add basic Prometheus metrics endpoint to Flask app for monitoring.
- Set up automated backup script for SQLite database and user data.
- Configure HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for security.

### Architecture Context

This story implements Production Deployment Architecture from the brownfield architecture. Essential for reliable operation as educational features increase system complexity and user engagement.

**Focus Areas:**

- Container orchestration (Docker Compose or Kubernetes)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, logging)
- Security hardening (HTTPS, authentication, data protection)
- Backup and recovery (user progress data, educational achievements)

### Key Constraints

- Deployment must be cost-effective for hobbyist/educational use
- Configuration must be maintainable by small team or individual
- Monitoring must provide clear signals without overwhelming complexity

### Testing

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_deployment.py`
- **Framework**: pytest with infrastructure testing

- Add monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, logging) as containerized services
- Implement production database configuration and backup procedures

**Existing Pattern Reference:**

- Follow current Docker and docker-compose structure and organization
- Use existing Flask configuration patterns for environment-specific settings
- Maintain current application startup and service interaction patterns

**Key Constraints:**

- Deployment must be cost-effective for hobbyist/educational use

- **Mitigation:** Documentation, automated deployment scripts, simple monitoring setup
- **Rollback:** Containerized architecture allows easy rollback to previous versions

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing Docker development configuration
- [x] Production deployment is additive to current containerization approach
- [x] Monitoring and scaling enhance reliability without disrupting application logic
- [x] Deployment complexity is manageable for target user base (hobbyist/educational)
