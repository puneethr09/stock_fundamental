- Configure HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for security.

### Architecture Context

This story implements Production Deployment Architecture from the brownfield architecture. Essential for reliable operation as educational features increase system complexity and user engagement.

**Focus Areas:**

- Container orchestration (Docker Compose or Kubernetes)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, logging)
- Security hardening (HTTPS, authentication, data protection)
- Backup and recovery (user progress data, educational achievements)

### Key Constraints

- Deployment must be cost-effective for hobbyist/educational use
- Configuration must be maintainable by small team or individual
- Monitoring must provide clear signals without overwhelming complexity

### Testing

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_deployment.py`
- **Framework**: pytest with infrastructure testing

- Add monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, logging) as containerized services
- Implement production database configuration and backup procedures

**Existing Pattern Reference:**

- Follow current Docker and docker-compose structure and organization
- Use existing Flask configuration patterns for environment-specific settings
- Maintain current application startup and service interaction patterns

**Key Constraints:**

- Deployment must be cost-effective for hobbyist/educational use
- Configuration must be maintainable by small team or individual

- **Mitigation:** Documentation, automated deployment scripts, simple monitoring setup
- **Rollback:** Containerized architecture allows easy rollback to previous versions

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing Docker development configuration
- [x] Production deployment is additive to current containerization approach
- [x] Monitoring and scaling enhance reliability without disrupting application logic
- [x] Deployment complexity is manageable for target user base (hobbyist/educational)
