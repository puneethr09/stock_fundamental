# Story: Pattern Recognition Training System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** platform user learning stock analysis,
**I want** interactive exercises that teach me to recognize financial patterns at my skill level,
**so that** I can develop intuitive pattern recognition skills and progress from guided analysis to independent thinking.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System generates pattern recognition exercises based on user's learning stage
2. Interactive exercises include debt analysis, growth indicators, and value traps
3. System provides immediate feedback during pattern recognition exercises
4. User progress in pattern recognition is tracked and influences learning stage assessment
5. Existing stock analysis and chart functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New pattern exercises follow existing Plotly chart interaction patterns
7. Integration with learning stage assessment system for exercise difficulty
8. Pattern recognition exercises are covered by unit and integration tests
9. Interactive elements work across mobile and desktop
10. No regression in existing chart functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement PatternRecognitionTrainer class with exercise generation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create exercise generation logic based on learning stages
  - [ ] Implement debt analysis pattern exercises
  - [ ] Implement growth indicator pattern exercises
  - [ ] Implement value trap detection exercises
  - [ ] Add immediate feedback system for pattern recognition attempts
- [ ] Integrate with existing Plotly chart system (AC: 5, 6, 10)
  - [ ] Extend existing chart functionality with interactive pattern overlays
  - [ ] Maintain existing Plotly chart patterns and behaviors
  - [ ] Ensure no regression in current chart display functionality
- [ ] Connect with learning stage assessment system (AC: 4, 7)
  - [ ] Track pattern recognition progress and accuracy
  - [ ] Adjust exercise difficulty based on assessed learning stage
  - [ ] Feed pattern recognition results back to stage assessment
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing and mobile compatibility (AC: 8, 9)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for PatternRecognitionTrainer class
  - [ ] Add integration tests for chart interaction workflow
  - [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness of interactive exercises
  - [ ] Test pattern recognition feedback system

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the Interactive Pattern Recognition System from the Financial Education Mastery Framework. The system provides stage-appropriate exercises:

**Exercise Types by Learning Stage:**

- **Stage 1 - Guided Discovery**: Basic pattern identification with heavy guidance
- **Stage 2 - Assisted Analysis**: Pattern comparison across multiple stocks
- **Stage 3 - Independent Thinking**: Blind pattern recognition challenges
- **Stage 4 - Analytical Mastery**: Complex pattern teaching and validation

### Existing System Integration

- **Current Chart System**: Extend Plotly charts in `templates/` with interactive pattern overlays
- **Analysis Integration**: Hook into existing analysis results in `src/basic_analysis.py`
- **Learning Integration**: Connect with EducationalMasteryFramework from learning stage assessment story
- **UI Pattern**: Follow existing interactive elements and educational tooltip system

### Technical Implementation Details

- **PatternRecognitionTrainer Class**: Implement in new `src/pattern_trainer.py`
- **Exercise Generation**: Algorithm based on user learning stage and available stock data
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript enhancements to existing Plotly chart system
- **Feedback System**: Real-time pattern recognition validation with educational guidance

### Key Constraints

- Must work with existing Plotly chart system without breaking functionality
- Interactive exercises must be responsive across devices
- Exercise generation must work with free data sources only (yfinance)
- Performance impact < 100ms additional rendering time

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_pattern_trainer.py`
- **Framework**: pytest (following existing test patterns)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for new pattern recognition functionality
- **Frontend Testing**: JavaScript testing for interactive elements

#### Specific Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for PatternRecognitionTrainer exercise generation logic
- Integration tests for chart interaction workflow with existing Plotly system
- Mobile responsiveness testing for interactive exercises
- Performance testing to verify rendering impact
- Regression testing for existing chart functionality

## Dev Agent Record

_This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation_

## QA Results

_This section will be populated by the QA agent after implementation review_

1. **Financial Health Patterns** - Debt spirals, quality growth, value traps, turnaround potential
2. **Market Behavior Patterns** - Sector rotation, sentiment extremes, news vs fundamentals
3. **Stage-Appropriate Exercises** - From guided discovery to teaching scenarios
4. **Immediate Feedback** - Progressive revelation of insights during exercises

The system generates exercises using existing stock data and integrates with the learning stage assessment to provide appropriate difficulty levels.
