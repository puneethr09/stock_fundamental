# Story: Community Knowledge Base System

## Status

Completed

## Story

**As a** platform user sharing or seeking investment insights,
**I want** to contribute and access community-driven qualitative analysis and stock insights,
**so that** I can share my research findings and learn from other users' analysis to fill knowledge gaps.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can contribute insights for stocks (moat analysis, management assessments, competitive analysis)
2. Community insights are displayed alongside analysis results for relevant stocks
3. Users can vote on insight quality with simple validation system
4. System maintains anonymous contributions while preventing spam
5. Existing stock analysis and data display functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New community features follow existing user session and data storage patterns
7. Integration with analysis results maintains current display behavior
8. Community contribution system is covered by unit and integration tests
9. Data validation prevents spam while allowing genuine contributions
10. No regression in existing analysis functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement CommunityKnowledgeBase class with contribution management (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create contribution submission system for stock insights
  - [x] Implement anonymous contribution tracking with spam prevention
  - [x] Add insight categories (moat analysis, management, competitive analysis)
- [x] Extend database schema for community insights (AC: 2, 6)
  - [x] Create community insights database tables
  - [x] Add data models following existing Flask patterns
  - [x] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [x] Integrate community insights with analysis results display (AC: 2, 5, 7)
  - [x] Add community insights section to analysis results template
  - [x] Maintain existing analysis result display behavior
  - [x] Ensure seamless integration without breaking current functionality
- [x] Implement insight quality validation system (AC: 3, 9, 10)
  - [x] Create simple voting mechanism for insight quality
  - [x] Add spam prevention and content moderation
  - [x] Implement comprehensive testing for community features
  - [x] Verify no regression in existing analysis functionality

## Dev Notes

- [x] Database schema extended with community insights tables
- [x] Community insights display integrated with analysis results

### Architecture Context

This story implements the Community Knowledge Base from the Financial Education Mastery Framework. The system enables users to share qualitative research that complements quantitative Five Rules analysis, particularly valuable for areas where data is limited.

**Community Contribution Types:**

- Moat analysis and competitive advantage insights
- Management quality assessments and governance observations
- Industry analysis and competitive landscape insights
- Company-specific qualitative research findings

### Existing System Integration

- **Database Layer**: Extend existing database models with community insights tables
- **Analysis Integration**: Add community insights to analysis results in `templates/results.html`
- **Session Management**: Use existing user session handling for anonymous contribution tracking
- **Data Storage**: Follow current Flask database patterns and migration approaches

### Technical Implementation Details

- **CommunityKnowledgeBase Class**: Implement in new `src/community_knowledge.py`
- **Database Schema**: Add tables for insights, votes, and spam prevention
- **Quality Control**: Simple voting system with spam detection algorithms
- **Anonymous Tracking**: Session-based contribution tracking without user registration

### Key Constraints

- User contributions must be anonymous but trackable for spam prevention
- Community insights must complement, not replace, quantitative analysis
- System must work without requiring user registration
- Performance impact < 100ms additional loading time

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_community_knowledge.py`
- **Framework**: pytest (following existing test patterns)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for new community functionality
- **Database Testing**: Include migration testing and data validation

#### Specific Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for CommunityKnowledgeBase contribution management
- Integration tests with existing analysis results display
- Database migration testing for community insights tables
- Spam prevention and content validation testing
- Performance testing for community insights loading
- Regression testing for existing analysis functionality
