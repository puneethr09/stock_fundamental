## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the Educational Gap-Filling Approach from the Financial Education Mastery Framework. The system converts data limitations into learning opportunities by detecting low-confidence analysis areas and providing structured research guidance.

**Gap Detection Triggers:**

- Missing financial ratios (when yfinance data is incomplete)
- Low data availability periods (< 3 years of historical data)
- Industry-specific metrics unavailable
- Management/governance information gaps
- Competitive landscape data limitations

**Research Guide Categories:**

- **Economic Moats Research**: Step-by-step competitive analysis guides
- **Management Assessment**: Governance and leadership evaluation frameworks
- **Industry Analysis**: Sector-specific research methodologies
- **Financial Deep-Dive**: Manual calculation guides when automated data fails

### Existing System Integration

**Integration Points:**

- **Analysis Flow**: Extend `analyze_ratios()` in `src/basic_analysis.py` with gap detection
- **Results Display**: Add gap-filling section to `templates/results.html` after warning section
- **Flask Routes**: Extend `/analyze` route in `app.py` to include gap analysis
- **Session Management**: Use existing Flask session to track research progress

**Data Flow Integration:**

```
Five Rules Analysis → Gap Detection → Research Guide Generation → Display Integration
```

### Technical Implementation Details

**Core Implementation:**

- **File**: `src/gap_filling_service.py`
- **Class**: `EducationalGapFillingService`
- **Integration**: Called from `analyze_ratios()` function

**Key Methods:**

```python
def detect_analysis_gaps(ratios_df, warnings, company_name)
def generate_research_guides(identified_gaps, ticker)
def get_indian_market_sources(research_category)
def track_research_progress(session, assignments)
```

**Gap Detection Logic:**

- Check for None/NaN values in critical ratios
- Identify historical data availability gaps
- Detect industry-specific missing metrics
- Flag low confidence warnings as research opportunities

**Indian Market Specific Sources:**

- BSE/NSE annual reports and investor presentations
- Economic Times, Business Standard archives
- Company regulatory filings (BSE/NSE websites)
- Industry reports from CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM

### Key Constraints

- Research guides must be actionable with free/public sources only
- Gap identification must not slow down analysis (< 50ms overhead)
- Research assignments must be contextual to Indian regulatory environment
- Progress tracking must work without user registration (session-based)
- All sources must be publicly accessible and current

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_gap_filling_service.py`
- **Framework**: pytest (following existing test patterns in `tests/test_basic_analysis.py`)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for new gap-filling functionality
- **Mock Data**: Use test datasets with intentional gaps to verify detection logic
- **Indian Market Testing**: Validate research guides with real NSE/BSE examples

#### Specific Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**

- Gap detection logic with various ratios_df scenarios (missing data, NaN values)
- Research guide generation for different gap categories
- Indian market source validation and accessibility verification
- Session-based progress tracking functionality
- Gap severity scoring system accuracy

**Integration Testing:**

- Seamless integration with existing `analyze_ratios()` workflow
- Template rendering with gap-filling section in `results.html`
- Flask route integration for research progress endpoints
- Community insights interaction (when both features active)

**Performance Testing:**

- Gap detection processing time < 50ms overhead
- Research guide generation performance with large datasets
- Memory usage impact on existing analysis workflow

**Quality Assurance:**

- Research guide accuracy with real Indian stock examples (TCS, Reliance, HDFC)
- Source accessibility verification for all recommended Indian resources
- Progress tracking reliability across user sessions

**Regression Testing:**

- Existing Five Rules analysis functionality unchanged
- Warning system behavior maintained
- Results template display integrity verified
