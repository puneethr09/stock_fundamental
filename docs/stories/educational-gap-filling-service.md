# Story: Educational Gap-Filling Service

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** platform user encountering data limitations during analysis,
**I want** guided research assignments and learning prompts when data is missing,
**so that** I can learn to research missing information independently and turn limitations into learning opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System detects when analysis has low confidence due to missing data
2. System generates step-by-step research guides for identified data gaps
3. System provides research questions and recommended sources for manual investigation
4. User can track completion of research assignments and learning progress
5. Existing Five Rules analysis functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New gap identification follows existing analysis confidence pattern
7. Integration with analysis results display maintains current behavior
8. Gap identification logic is covered by unit and integration tests
9. Research guides are contextually relevant to Indian stock market
10. No regression in existing analysis functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement EducationalGapFillingService class with gap identification (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create gap detection logic for low confidence analysis results
  - [ ] Implement research guide generation for different gap types
  - [ ] Add step-by-step research assignment creation
- [ ] Create research guides for key analysis areas (AC: 3, 9)
  - [ ] Economic moats research guides with Indian market examples
  - [ ] Management quality assessment guides
  - [ ] Industry analysis and competitive landscape research guides
  - [ ] Recommended sources specific to Indian stock market
- [ ] Integrate with existing analysis results system (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Extend existing Five Rules analysis with gap identification
  - [ ] Add gap-filling prompts to analysis result display
  - [ ] Maintain existing analysis confidence patterns
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and testing (AC: 4, 8, 10)
  - [ ] Create research assignment completion tracking
  - [ ] Add unit tests for EducationalGapFillingService
  - [ ] Verify no regression in existing analysis functionality
  - [ ] Test research guide quality with Indian stock examples

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the Educational Gap-Filling Approach from the Financial Education Mastery Framework. The system converts data limitations into learning opportunities by:

**Gap Types Addressed:**

- Economic moats assessment when competitive data is limited
- Management quality evaluation when governance data is unavailable
- Industry analysis when sector-specific metrics are missing
- Competitive landscape when peer comparison data is insufficient

### Existing System Integration

- **Current Analysis**: Extend Five Rules analysis in `src/basic_analysis.py`
- **Confidence System**: Build on existing analysis confidence indicators
- **Results Display**: Integrate with existing analysis results in `templates/results.html`
- **Educational System**: Connect with existing educational content delivery patterns

### Technical Implementation Details

- **EducationalGapFillingService Class**: Implement in new `src/gap_filling_service.py`
- **Gap Detection**: Algorithm to identify low confidence areas in analysis
- **Research Guide Generation**: Contextual guides based on missing data types
- **Indian Market Context**: Specific examples using NSE/BSE stocks and sources

### Key Constraints

- Research guides must be specific to Indian stock market context
- Gap identification must work with free data source limitations (yfinance)
- Research assignments must be actionable without premium data access
- Performance impact < 50ms additional processing

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- **Test Location**: `tests/test_gap_filling_service.py`
- **Framework**: pytest (following existing test patterns)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for new gap-filling functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Verify seamless integration with Five Rules analysis

#### Specific Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for EducationalGapFillingService gap identification logic
- Integration tests with existing Five Rules analysis workflow
- Research guide quality verification with Indian stock examples
- Performance testing to verify processing impact
- Regression testing for existing analysis functionality
