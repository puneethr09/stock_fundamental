# Stock Analysis Automation Project

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the analysis of Indian stock market data from various indexes including Nifty 200, Nifty 500, Nifty 50, Nifty Large Midcap 250, Nifty Midcap 100, and Nifty Smallcap 250. The script fetches financial data using Yahoo Finance, calculates industry averages, and scores each stock based on predefined weights, ultimately providing a sorted list of top-performing stocks.

## Features
- **Automated Data Fetching**: Retrieves financial data for each stock ticker from Yahoo Finance.
- **Industry Averages Calculation**: Computes average P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and EPS for each sector.
- **Stock Scoring**: Scores each stock based on P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and EPS.
- **Top Stocks Selection**: Identifies and lists the top 10 stocks within each sector.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Allows selection of specific datasets or analysis of all available datasets.
- **Detailed Output**: Generates both text and CSV files with detailed analysis and scores.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- yfinance

## Usage
1. **Place Input Files**:
   Ensure all input CSV files are placed in the `input` directory. The supported files are:
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_200.csv`
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_500.csv`
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_50.csv`
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_large_midcap_250.csv`
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_midcap_100.csv`
   - `Indian_stocks_nifty_smallcap_250.csv`

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to start the analysis:
   ```sh
   python analyze_stocks.py

3. **Select Dataset**:
   When prompted, select the dataset you want to analyze:
   Select the dataset:
   ```sh
   1. Indian_stocks_nifty_200.csv
   2. Indian_stocks_nifty_500.csv
   3. Indian_stocks_nifty_50.csv
   4. Indian_stocks_nifty_large_midcap_250.csv
   5. Indian_stocks_nifty_midcap_100.csv
   6. Indian_stocks_nifty_smallcap_250.csv
   7. All files
   Enter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7:

## Output
The output files are saved in the `output` directory with the original input file name appended with `_analyzed`. For example, if analyzing `Indian_stocks_nifty_200.csv`, the output files will be:
- `Indian_stocks_nifty_200_analyzed.txt`
- `Indian_stocks_nifty_200_analyzed.csv`
