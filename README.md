#### **Native Python Installation on Pi**

```bash
# Install Python 3.10+ (may need to compile from source)
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev python3-pip

# Install build dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/puneethr09/stock_fundamental.git
cd stock_fundamental

# Create virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (this will take time on Pi)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For better performance, use gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn (production setup)
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 --workers 2 --timeout 120 app:app

# Access at http://raspberry-pi-ip:5001
```

#### **Raspberry Pi Performance Optimization**

```bash
# Increase swap size for compilation
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
# Change CONF_SWAPSIZE=100 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024
sudo dphys-swapfile setup
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon

# Memory management
echo 'vm.swappiness=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'vm.dirty_background_ratio=15' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'vm.dirty_ratio=25' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# CPU governor for performance
echo 'performance' | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Monitoring commands
# Check temperature: vcgencmd measure_temp
# Check memory: free -h
# Check CPU usage: htop
```

### 🌐 Network Configuration & Access

#### **Local Network Access**

```bash
# Find your machine's IP address

# On Linux/macOS:
ip addr show | grep inet
# OR
ifconfig | grep inet

# On Windows:
ipconfig

# Access from other devices on same network:
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5001
```

#### **Port Configuration**

```bash
# Default ports used:
# 5001 - Main application
# 3000 - Grafana monitoring dashboard
# 9090 - Prometheus metrics
# 9093 - Alertmanager
# 9100 - Node Exporter

# To change default port, modify docker-compose.yml:
# Change "5001:5001" to "8080:5001" for port 8080 access
```

#### **Firewall Configuration**

**Linux (UFW)**:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5001
sudo ufw allow 3000  # For Grafana
sudo ufw allow 9090  # For Prometheus
sudo ufw enable
```

**Windows Firewall**:

```powershell
# Allow specific port
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Stock Analysis App" -Direction Inbound -Port 5001 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

**macOS**:

```bash
# macOS usually doesn't block outgoing connections
# Incoming connections will prompt for permission
```

### 🔒 Security Configuration

#### **Production Security Checklist**

```bash
# Generate secure secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Create secure .env file
cat > .env << EOF
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=false

# Database encryption (if using production database)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/app.db
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=another-secure-key

# Monitoring credentials
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-grafana-password

# Email alerts (optional)
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@domain.com
EOF

# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

#### **SSL/HTTPS Setup (Advanced)**

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate for testing
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# Or use Let's Encrypt for production domain
sudo apt install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Update nginx configuration in nginx/nginx.conf
# Add SSL certificate paths and enable HTTPS redirects
```

### 🚀 Performance Optimization

#### **System Requirements by Deployment Type**

**Development/Testing**:

- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM, 1 CPU core, 5GB storage
- **Recommended**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 10GB storage

**Production (Light Usage)**:

- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 10GB storage
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 20GB storage

**Production (Heavy Usage)**:

- **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM, 8+ CPU cores, 50GB+ storage
- **Network**: 100Mbps+ for real-time data fetching

#### **Performance Tuning Commands**

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats
htop
iotop  # For disk I/O

# Scale services based on load
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --scale stock-analysis-app=5

# Database optimization
sqlite3 data/app.db "VACUUM;"
sqlite3 data/app.db "ANALYZE;"

# Cache optimization (add Redis for production)
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### **Docker Issues**

```bash
# Docker daemon not running
sudo systemctl start docker
# OR
sudo service docker start

# Permission denied
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout and login

# Out of disk space
docker system prune -a
docker volume prune

# Port already in use
lsof -i :5001  # Find what's using the port
kill -9 PID    # Kill the process
```

#### **Python Environment Issues**

```bash
# Module not found errors
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Virtual environment issues
deactivate
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Permission errors (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/stock_fundamental
```

#### **Network Issues**

```bash
# Cannot access from other devices
# Check if binding to all interfaces
# In app.py, ensure: app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)

# DNS resolution issues
# Add to /etc/hosts (Linux/macOS) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows)
127.0.0.1 stock-analysis.local

# Slow data fetching
# Check internet connection
curl -I https://finance.yahoo.com
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

### 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

#### **Health Check Commands**

```bash
# Application health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Docker container health
docker compose ps

# System resource monitoring
docker stats --no-stream

# Log monitoring
docker compose logs -f --tail=50

# Database size check
du -sh data/
```

#### **Backup Procedures**

```bash
# Manual backup
mkdir -p backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)
cp -r data/ backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)/
tar -czf backups/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz data/
