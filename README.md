#### **Local Network Access**

```bash
# Find your machine's IP address

# On Linux/macOS:
ip addr show | grep inet
# OR
ifconfig | grep inet

# On Windows:
ipconfig

# Access from other devices on same network:
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5001
```

#### **Port Configuration**

```bash
# Default ports used:
# 5001 - Main application
# 3000 - Grafana monitoring dashboard
# 9090 - Prometheus metrics
# 9093 - Alertmanager
# 9100 - Node Exporter

# To change default port, modify docker-compose.yml:
# Change "5001:5001" to "8080:5001" for port 8080 access
```

#### **Firewall Configuration**

**Linux (UFW)**:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5001
sudo ufw allow 3000  # For Grafana
sudo ufw allow 9090  # For Prometheus
sudo ufw enable
```

**Windows Firewall**:

```powershell
# Allow specific port
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Stock Analysis App" -Direction Inbound -Port 5001 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

**macOS**:

```bash
# macOS usually doesn't block outgoing connections
# Incoming connections will prompt for permission
```

### üîí Security Configuration

#### **Production Security Checklist**

```bash
# Generate secure secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Create secure .env file
cat > .env << EOF
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=false

# Database encryption (if using production database)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/app.db
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=another-secure-key

# Monitoring credentials
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-grafana-password

# Email alerts (optional)
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@domain.com
EOF

# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

#### **SSL/HTTPS Setup (Advanced)**

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate for testing
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# Or use Let's Encrypt for production domain
sudo apt install certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Update nginx configuration in nginx/nginx.conf
# Add SSL certificate paths and enable HTTPS redirects
